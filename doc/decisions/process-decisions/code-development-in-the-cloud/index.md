# Code development in the cloud

!!! info

    **Status**: WIP RFC
  
    **Level**: 2 (?)

    **Updated**: 2025-06-18

## Summary

Our staff software developers can work faster, and with higher capabilities, and
with better security, if we migrate from our current state of code development
on our local laptops to a future state of code development in the cloud.

In more detail: our organization currently relies primarily on local laptop
development environments for software engineering work. This way of working
presents multiple challenges, including inconsistent development environments,
security risks from storing sensitive code locally, limited computational
resources, and complex setup procedures for new team members. We are evaluating
cloud-powered development environments to address these limitations and improve
our development workflow efficiency and security posture.

## Drivers

Drivers that are current problems:

* Environment Inconsistency: "Works on my machine" issues due to varying local configurations

* Security Risks: Sensitive code and credentials stored on developer laptops

* Resource Limitations: Local hardware constraints limiting development capabilities

* Onboarding Friction: Time-intensive setup process for new developers

* Backup and Recovery: Risk of code loss due to hardware failures

* Compliance Concerns: Difficulty ensuring consistent security policies across local environments

Drivers that we want as benefits:

* Accelerate faster easier more-powerful development.

* Improve security because more work happens in the cloud, rather than on local laptops.

* Enable environments that are ephemeral and replaceable.

### Benefits in more detail

**Performance and Productivity**:

* Enhanced Computational Power: Access to high-performance cloud instances with scalable CPU, memory, and storage

* Faster Development Cycles: Pre-configured environments with instant startup and consistent tooling

* Reduced Setup Time: Zero-configuration environments that are ready to use immediately

**Security Improvements**:

* Centralized Code Security: Source code remains in secure cloud environments rather than on potentially vulnerable laptops

* Consistent Security Policies: Uniform security configurations across all development environments

* Reduced Data Exposure: Minimize sensitive data presence on local devices

* Audit Trail: Complete visibility into development activities and access patterns

**Operational Excellence**:

* Ephemeral Environments: Disposable environments that can be easily recreated and destroyed

* Standardization: Consistent development environments across all team members

* Simplified Maintenance: Centralized environment management and updates

* Disaster Recovery: Built-in backup and recovery capabilities

## Options
