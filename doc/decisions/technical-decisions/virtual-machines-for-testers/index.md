# Architecture Decision Record: Local Virtual Machines for Development and Testing

Status: WIP RFC

Updated: 2025-06-23

Level: 2?

## Context

Our team needs a consistent, reproducible environment solution for software
engineering and test automation. We require the ability to quickly provision,
configure, and tear down development and testing environments that can be easily
shared across team members and integrated into our CI/CD pipelines.

## Goals

- **Software Engineering**: Provide isolated development environments that mirror production

- **Software Test Automation**: Enable consistent test execution across different configurations

- **Recyclable Environments**: Quick provisioning and cleanup of environments to reduce resource overhead

Some of the testers are less-familiar with automation and with command line
tools, thus a desktop GUI may be better, at least for short term.

The rest of this ADR is AI-generated intended to spark discussion and compare/contrast.

## Options Considered

- Open Containers

- Cloud-Based Virtual Machines

- Local Virtual Machines

## Assessments

### Open Containers (Not Selected)

**Pros:**

- Lightweight resource usage
- Fast startup times
- Excellent for microservices
- Strong ecosystem and tooling

**Cons:**

- Shared kernel limitations for testing OS-level features
- Limited isolation for security testing
- Cannot test different operating systems simultaneously
- Networking complexity for multi-service testing

### Option 2: Cloud-Based Virtual Machines

**Pros:**

- Unlimited scalability
- No local resource constraints
- Managed infrastructure
- Easy team sharing

**Cons:**

- Network dependency and latency
- Ongoing operational costs
- Data sovereignty concerns
- Limited control over underlying infrastructure

### Option 3: Local Virtual Machines

**Pros:**

- Complete OS isolation and control
- Ability to test multiple operating systems
- No network dependency for development
- Full control over resource allocation
- Snapshot and rollback capabilities
- Cost-effective for long-term use

**Cons:**

- Higher resource requirements
- Slower startup compared to containers
- Local hardware limitations
- Manual infrastructure management

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- **Hypervisor**: VMware Workstation Pro / VirtualBox / Hyper-V (platform-dependent)
- **Automation**: Vagrant for VM provisioning and management
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible/Puppet for environment setup
- **Version Control**: VM templates and configuration stored in Git

### VM Specifications

- **Base Images**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Windows Server 2022, CentOS Stream 9
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Development VMs: 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 40GB storage
  - Test VMs: 2GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 20GB storage
- **Networking**: NAT + Host-only adapters for isolation and connectivity

### Automation Integration

- **Provisioning**: Automated via Vagrant + infrastructure-as-code
- **Testing**: Integration with test frameworks (JUnit, pytest, etc.)
- **CI/CD**: VM snapshots for consistent test baselines
- **Cleanup**: Automated destruction and recreation of test environments

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Consistency**: Identical environments across development and testing
- **Isolation**: Complete separation prevents test interference
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple OS and configuration testing
- **Offline Capability**: Development continues without internet dependency
- **Cost Control**: One-time setup cost with no ongoing cloud expenses

### Negative

- **Resource Requirements**: Higher CPU, RAM, and storage demands on developer machines
- **Setup Complexity**: Initial configuration requires VM management expertise
- **Performance Overhead**: Virtualization layer impacts performance
- **Portability**: VM images are large and challenging to transfer

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Hardware resource constraints limit concurrent VMs
  - **Mitigation**: Implement VM resource pooling and sharing strategies
- **Risk**: VM sprawl and management overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Automated lifecycle management and regular cleanup processes
- **Risk**: Inconsistent VM configurations across team members
  - **Mitigation**: Standardized VM templates and automated provisioning scripts

## Monitoring and Review

- Monthly review of VM resource utilization and performance
- Quarterly assessment of alternative technologies and cost comparison
- Team feedback collection on development workflow impact
- Annual evaluation of cloud vs. local cost-benefit analysis

## Next Steps

1. Prototype VM setup with Vagrant and base OS images
2. Develop standardized VM templates for common use cases
3. Create automation scripts for VM lifecycle management
4. Establish team training and documentation
5. Implement monitoring and resource management tools
6. Plan migration strategy for existing development environments
