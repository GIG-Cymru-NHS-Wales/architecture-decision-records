# Architecture Principles

Architecture principles are fundamental rules and guidelines that inform and
support the way we design and develop technology solutions across NHS Wales. They
help ensure consistency, promote best practices, and align our technology
decisions with organisational goals.

## Approved Principles

The following principles have been formally reviewed and approved by the DHCW
Technical Design Authority (TDA):

* [Architecture Principles](architecture-principles/index.md) - Our foundational
  principles that guide all architectural decisions
* [Open Architecture & Integration](open-architecture/index.md) - Guidelines for
  creating interoperable and extensible systems
* [Digital Workplace](digital-workplace/index.md) - Principles for creating
  effective digital working environments
* [Data & Analytics](data-and-analytics/index.md) - Guidelines for data
  management, analytics, and insights
* [Cloud & Infrastructure](cloud-and-infrastructure/index.md) - Principles for
  cloud adoption and infrastructure design
* [Security & Identity](security-and-identity/index.md) - Core security and
  identity management principles

## Principles Under Development

The following principles are currently being developed and reviewed. While not yet
formally approved, they provide valuable guidance in their respective areas:

* [User-Centred Design](user-centred-design/index.md) - Principles for creating
  services that meet user needs
* [Digital Products & Software Engineering](digital-products-and-software-engineering/index.md) -
  Best practices for building and maintaining digital products
* Clinical Principles _(Coming Soon)_ - Guidelines for clinical systems and
  healthcare technology

## Using These Principles

These principles should be:

* Referenced when making architectural decisions
* Used to evaluate proposed solutions
* Considered during system design and development
* Referenced in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

If you need to deviate from these principles, document your rationale in an ADR
and seek appropriate approval through the [governance
process](../design-authority/dhcw/architecture-decision-record-process/index.md).
