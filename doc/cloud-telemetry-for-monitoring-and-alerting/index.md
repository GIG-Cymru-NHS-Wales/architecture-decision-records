# Cloud telemetry for monitoring and alerting

!!! info

    **Status**: Work In Progress - Request For Comments

    **Level**: 3?

    **Updated**: 2025-06-20

## Summary

Our emergency department module is heading towards production release, and we're
discovering a variety of cloud telemetry needs, such as for DNS monitoring, to
network resilience questions, and application health information.

We have had first discussions with our Head of Cloud and our MS365 team. This
ADR is a work in progress and request for comments, to spark conversations and
participation.

## Drivers

We are ramping up the learning curve for cloud telemetry, cloud monitoring,
cloud observability, cloud application health checks, cloud container throttle
releases, and the like.

The rest of the ADR is generated by Claude, and is all synthetic-- there is no
information specific to our organization. This is so we can start discussions.

**Key Objectives:**

* Implement comprehensive observability across Azure and GCP environments

* Establish unified telemetry collection using OpenTelemetry standards

* Ensure 99.9% uptime through proactive monitoring and alerting

* Optimize costs while maintaining monitoring effectiveness

* Enable rapid incident detection and resolution

**Key Benefits:**

* **Proactive Issue Detection:** Identify problems before they impact users

* **Faster Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Reduce incident response times by 60-80%

* **Performance Optimization:** Data-driven insights for system improvements

* **Cost Optimization:** Resource usage visibility enables efficient scaling

**Key Tactic: standardized telemetry collection:**

* **Instrumenting applications** with OpenTelemetry (OTel) in Application Insights enables standardized telemetry collection across platforms. This improves observability, simplifies performance monitoring, and supports distributed tracing, metrics, and log analysis

* **Vendor-neutral approach** ensuring portability across cloud providers

* **Automatic instrumentation** options for different application types, and manual intrumentation for rare cases where automatic instrumentation isn't viable.

* **Consistent data models** across Azure and GCP environments.
